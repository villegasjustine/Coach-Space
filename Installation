## Introduction

This guide will help you get started with the Coach-Space project. Coach-Space is a web application that helps coaches manage their training programs and users track their exercises. It's built using Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize, MySQL, and React.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js:** You need Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

- **MySQL:** You need MySQL installed locally or have access to a MySQL server. You can download MySQL from [https://www.mysql.com/](https://www.mysql.com/).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/villegasjustine/capstone
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd capstone-app
   ```

3. **Install dependencies for the frontend:**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install axios dayjs react react-cookie react-dom react-router-dom vite 
   ```

4. **Install dependencies for the backend:**

   npm install bcryptjs cors dotenv jsonwebtoken mysql2 sequelize
   ```

## Configuration

Before running the application, you need to configure it:

1. **Database Configuration:**

   - Create a MySQL database for your project.


NODE_ENV = local

DB_NAME=capstone
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=2@!3V!ll
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3307

   ```

2. **Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and set the following environment variables:

   ```env
   PORT=8080
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
   ```

   Replace `CWJkeykey` with a strong, unique secret key for your application.

## Running the Application

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. **Start the backend server:**

   In the `backend` directory, run:

   ```bash
